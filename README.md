# tic-tac-tor-game
Developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a win or draw after every move and provides visual feedback to the players. The UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
